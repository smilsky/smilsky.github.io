In this project I analyzed crimes in Vancouver. I tried to find certain patterns, make some predictions, and potentially build recommendations based on my insights. The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wosaku/crime-in-vancouver).

```python
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, Imputer, LabelBinarizer, LabelEncoder
    from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    import seaborn as sns
    from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
    import keras
    from keras.models import Sequential
```
After importing the libraries I started my analysis, which consisted of the following steps.

*1. Find out the basic information - how many different types of crimes and neighbourhoods in Vancouver.*
```python
    print(str(len(crimes.TYPE.unique())) + " different types of crime in the table:")
    print(crimes.TYPE.unique())
```
