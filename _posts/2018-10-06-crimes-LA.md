### Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze crimes that occurred in Los Angeles, CA, between 2010 and the present day. Based on the analysis, I am aiming at identifying some of the major trends and suggesting solutions where applicable.

### Necessary imports:
```r
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(devtools)
install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
library(RColorBrewer)
library(dplyr)
library(xlsx)
register_google(key="my IP key")
```
### Data Source
The data that I used is a CSV file which I found on [catalog.dat.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2010-to-present). It contains over 1,800,000 rows of crime incidents, reported in LA between 2010 and today. The dimensions include time and date occurred, type, area where occurred, premise description, coordinates etc. Many fields contained empty cells, therefore, upon reading the CSV file, I replaced all the empty cells with NA and then replaced NA with zeros for further analysis, if it was necessary.
```r
    LACrimes<- read.csv("Crime_Data_from_2010_to_Present.csv", na.strings=c("","NA"))
    crimes<-data.table(LACrimes)
```

### Q1: What are the top 10 crimes in LA?
For the first insight in my project, I wanted to find out what the most common crimes in Los Angeles are. I counted the number of occurrences for each crime type and plotted a bar chart using “ggplot”. The result is shown below:
```r
    counts<- crimes[, .(number = .N), by = Crime.Code.Description][order(-number)]
    counts<-counts[1:10]
    View(counts)

    bargraph<-ggplot(counts, aes(x = reorder(Crime.Code.Description, -number), y = number)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label=number), position = position_dodge(width = 1),
                                              vjust = -0.5, size = 3)
    bargraph<-bargraph + labs(x="Crime Types",y="Number",title="Top 10 Crimes in LA")
    bargraph<-bargraph + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size  = 9,angle = 45,hjust = 1,vjust = 1))
    bargraph<-bargraph +aes(fill=number)+scale_fill_gradient(low = "#FF0707", high = "#720303")
    bargraph
```

From the graph, it can be seen that the most frequent crimes are battery (simple assault), burglary from vehicle, stolen vehicles, burglary, different kinds of minor theft, partner assault, and vandalism. An interesting fact is that the number of the top 1 crime is almost twice greater than of the 10th. Based on the data, I would recommend that police focus on the hotspots (which I will address in Q2), keep in mind the presence of drugs in the city, and use other ways of crime prevention. Unfortunately, the data source does not provide details about the motives of the crimes, therefore, my recommendation cannot be very specific.

### Q2: Which areas have the greatest numbers of crime?
To answer this question I used several packages, including “ggmap” and “ggplot”. The first one gave me an opportunity to import Google maps into RStudio, and the second one allowed me to plot dots on the imported map.
```r
crimes<-crimes[!is.na(crimes$Location),]
crimes<-(crimes %>% separate(Location, into=c("lat","long"),sep=",")) #to separate latitutde and longitude
crimes$lat = as.numeric(gsub("\\(", "", crimes$lat)) #remove the bracket from the column and convert to numeric
crimes$long = as.numeric(gsub("\\)", "", crimes$long))

map<- get_map(location = c(lon = -118.34, lat = 34.05), zoom = 10,
              maptype = "roadmap", scale = 2)
ggmap(map)
ggmap(map) +
  geom_point(data = crimes, aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = "red", alpha = 0.4), size = 1, shape = 21)
```

It was quite a challenging part of my project from the technical point of view. I had to register the project with Google Cloud Platform and get the API key so that I could connect to Google Maps through RStudio. I managed to do this only when I found the “ggmap” package on GitHub with the explicit function for setting the API key.

I also had to prepare the data for plotting. I separated the “Location” column into “latitude” and “longitude”, so that the values could be used with the “ggmap” library.Another difficulty was actually plotting the dots and choosing the right parameters for visualization as I had to fit almost 2 million dots on a small map. This was also time-consuming – I had to wait several minutes each time I plotted the data. The result gave the following:

It was difficult to determine which districts of the city had the greatest numbers of crime because the map was heavily filled with dots, but it was obvious which parts of the city had the less crime. This was the South-West at the area of Torrano, especially on the West Coast, and the Eastern part of the metropolitan area. However, I don’t know whether this is due to the bias in the data gathered, or if it is really like this, because the difference is significant.

To see which exactly areas of the city had the biggest numbers of crime, I counted the number of crimes for each area name in the table. This gave the following results:
```r
View(unique(crimes$Area.Name))

countsArea<-crimes[, .(number = .N), by = Area.Name][order(-number)]

barA<-ggplot(countsArea, aes(x = reorder(Area.Name, -number), y = number)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label=number), position = position_dodge(width = 1),
                                          vjust = -0.5, size = 3)
barA<-barA + labs(x="Area",y="Number",title="Number of Crimes by Area")
barA<-barA + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size  = 9,angle = 45,hjust = 1,vjust = 1))
barA<-barA +aes(fill=number)+scale_fill_gradient(low = "#D0E1FC", high = "#015FFD")
barA<-barA + scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(25000,50000,75000,100000,125000))
barA
```

My recommendation is, therefore, for police to keep a close eye on the behavior in those districts and strengthen their surveillance there.

### 3. At what time the greatest number of crimes?
To address this question, I first separated the Time.Occurred column to extract the hours and then counted the number of crime occurrences for each hour (from 1 to 24). Then I plotted a clock function, which I found somewhere on the Internet. It was quite useful to visualize the results, which are the following:
<img src="/images/crimes_la/4.jpeg" alt="">

I am surprised that a lot of crimes have occurred in the morning – between 7 a.m. and 12 p.m. as well as in the afternoon – between 1 and 5 p.m. However, it does not surprise me that the greatest number of crimes happened between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m.

To see what the most frequent crimes for each hour were, I calculated the mode for each crime time by creating a Mode function and filtered the results in a new table by hour:
```r
#by time and type

newtimes<-crimes[,Time.Occurred,Crime.Code.Description]
newtimes<-newtimes %>% separate(Time.Occurred,into=c("hour","min"),sep = -2)
newtimes$hour[newtimes$hour==""] <- 0
View(newtimes)

Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))]
}

#newtimes[, mode:= Mode(Crime.Code.Description), by=hour][]

newtimes<-newtimes %>% group_by(hour) %>% mutate(c=Mode(Crime.Code.Description))

crimeByHour<-newtimes %>%
  select(hour,c) %>%
  distinct()
str(crimeByHour$hour)
crimeByHour$hour<-as.numeric(as.character(crimeByHour$hour))
crimeByHour<-data.table(crimeByHour)
crimeByHour<-crimeByHour[order(hour)]

write.xlsx(crimeByHour,"crimeByHour.xlsx")
```
Then I exported the table to Excel to get a more aesthetic look:
<img src="/images/crimes_la/5.jpg" alt="">

From the table, it is visible that the most common crime at 4 a.m. (when the number of crimes is the greatest overall) is burglary. Therefore, my recommendation is to increase patrolling at that time of the day. Also, civils should be more cautious and improve security at their homes. Overall, security should be improved overall, both at residential and commercial properties because burglary is number 4 crime in LA.

### Q4: What is the trend in the number of crimes in LA in the past years?
Finally, I wanted to see what the general trend in crimes in LA has been in the past years. I first separated the Date.Occurred column to extract the year. Then I calculated the number of occurrences for each year:
```r
trend<-crimes%>%separate(Date.Occurred,into=c("Month","Day","Year"),sep="/")
trend$Year<-as.numeric(as.character(trend$Year))
trend<-data.table(trend[,.(number=.N),by=Year][order(Year)])
trend<-trend[-nrow(trend),]

ggplot(data=trend)+geom_line(mapping=aes(x=Year,y=number),size=2,col="#A70910")+
  ylim(0,250000)+labs(title="Trend in the number of crimes",y="Number of Crimes")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = round(seq(min(trend$Year), max(trend$Year), by = 1),1))+
  geom_text(aes(x=Year,y=number,label=number), position = position_dodge(width = 1),vjust = -1, size = 4)+
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5), panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 1))+
  theme(text = element_text(size=20))+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(color = "#C3EBFC", fill="#C3EBFC"))
```
This gave the following result:
<img src="/images/crimes_la/6.jpeg" alt="">

As it can be seen from the graph, unfortunately, the trend in the number of crimes is negative: despite a decrease in numbers in 2012-2013, the overall trend is the increase in the number of crimes. Therefore, the city should watch closer at the issue and work on the ways of crime prevention as well as adhere to some of the recommendations presented earlier in the paper.
